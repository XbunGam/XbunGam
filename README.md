### Hello guys ğŸ‘‹
My name is Bun. I'm currently interested in coding and software engineering.

**XbunGam/XbunGam** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some coding
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on not yet
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with no one yet
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about nothing
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: [redacted]
- âš¡ Fun fact: I still have a barbecue sauce that expired 3 years ago
