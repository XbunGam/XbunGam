### Hello guys 👋
You can call me Bun. I'm currently interested in coding and software engineering.

**XbunGam/XbunGam** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on nothing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some coding
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on not yet
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with no one yet
- 💬 Ask me about nothing
- 📫 How to reach me: [redacted]
- ⚡ Fun fact: I still have a barbecue sauce that expired 3 years ago
